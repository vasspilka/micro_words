 - Need to put a bit more work in defining them


Artifact

rethink view

World energy static or not
actors getting energy through sleep or activity

Can use binary for trait numbers for lower memory consumption


World has dimensions [x] || [x,x] or more
Explorer takes journey on world "map" through locations



Materials
  For now we only create user posts somewhat like twitter
  There will be interactions with materials though somewhat like social media
  interactions can either be skills or artifact special (in case of special material like landmarks)
  or higher energy materials


  Later people could post images or sound snippets (maybe parts of rulesets)



NPCs

 - Druid will harvest and plant to random locations
 - Troll (feeds of note  and hackles players) xD

Action Progress
 - Consider having forward/backward progress instead of stages





 Daydream:

Randomly generated environment
 - landmarks (are static and can have benefits)
 - food can be consumed or left
 - nothing [empty fields, user can place materials]
 - NPCs? Monsters or other entities
 - Materials User generated environment


Traits
  - Randomly generated for each explorer
  - Can be upgradable? (could use modifiers for random generation then upgadable based on that)
    can even have upper limit


  + Awareness (can know more about environment, even about game mechanics or personal stats as health and stamina)
  + Stamina (how much free movement you can do, also movement cost)
  + Memory (can help see movement history and tips with previous experience)
  + Stealth (how well one can hide from other players npcs)
  + Constitution (health and regeneration)
  + Efficiency (Skill cost? cost of existance?)
  + Spirit (Energy and "luck")
  + Mass? (strength and )
  + Vision?

Skills
  - Can be learned
  - Have trait requirements


  scope: explorer
  + Assume Identity

  scope: material
  + Boost
  + Impair
  + Harvest (can seed same material)
  + Sign (seeds will have author name, only can sign own)?
