Artifact

rethink view

World energy static or not
actors getting energy through sleep or activity

Can use binary for trait numbers for lower memory consumption


World has dimensions [x] || [x,x] or more
Explorer takes journey on world "map" through locations

Randomly generated environment
 - landmarks (are static and can have benefits)
 - food can be consumed or left
 - nothing [empty fields, user can place artefacts]
 - NPCs? Monsters or other entities
 - Artefacts User generated environment


Traits
  - Randomly generated for each explorer
  - Can be upgradable? (could use modifiers for random generation then upgadable based on that)
    can even have upper limit


  + Awareness (can know more about environment, even about game mechanics or personal stats as health and stamina)
  + Stamina (how much free movement you can do, also movement cost)
  + Memory (can help see movement history and tips with previous experience)
  + Stealth (how well one can hide from other players npcs)
  + Constitution (health and regeneration)
  + Efficiency (Skill cost? cost of existance?)
  + Spirit (Energy and "luck")
  + Mass? (strength and )
  + Vision?


Skills
  - Can be learned
  - Have trait requirements


  scope: explorer
  + Assume Identity

  scope: artefact
  + Boost
  + Impair
  + Harvest (can seed same artefact)
  + Sign (seeds will have author name, only can sign own)?


Artefacts
  For now we only create user posts somewhat like twitter
  There will be interactions with artefacts though somewhat like social media
  interactions can either be skills or artifact special (in case of special artefact like landmarks)
  or higher energy artefacts


  Later people could post images or sound snippets (maybe parts of rulesets)



NPCs

 - Druid will harvest and plant to random locations
 - Troll (feeds of note  and hackles players) xD
